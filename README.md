## Description
The task this week was to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. The site was built completely from scratch and is deployed to Render. The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.rom developers with more traditional portfolios.

### User Story
As a developer who writes about tech I want a CMS-style blog site so that I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions.

## Installation

Clone the repo: git clone SSH git@github.com:lvdean/Tech-blog-site.git

Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

Next, use the terminal to run the command `npm i` to install the dependencies associated with this application.

To start the server `npm run start`
